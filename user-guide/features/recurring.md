# Recurring Snoozes (PRO)

Create snoozes that repeat automatically—perfect for daily standups, weekly reviews, or monthly reports.

## How It Works

A recurring snooze:
1. Wakes at the scheduled time
2. Opens your tab(s)
3. Automatically reschedules for the next occurrence
4. Repeats until you cancel it

## Setting Up a Recurring Snooze

1. Click **"Pick a date & time"**
2. Toggle **Repeat** ON
3. Choose your interval (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly)
4. Configure the schedule
5. Click **Snooze**

## Repeat Intervals

### Daily
Opens at the same time every day.

**Example:** Hacker News at 9:00 AM daily

### Weekly
Opens on selected days at the same time.

**Example:**
- Standup page on Mon, Wed, Fri at 9:00 AM
- Week review on Friday at 4:00 PM

### Monthly
Opens on a specific day of the month.

**Example:**
- Monthly report on the 1st at 9:00 AM
- Invoice review on the 15th

### Yearly
Opens on a specific date each year.

**Example:**
- Annual review prep on Dec 1st
- License renewal reminder

## Managing Recurring Snoozes

### In the Sleeping Tab
Recurring snoozes show a **repeat icon** and display:
- Next wake time
- Repeat schedule (e.g., "Mon, Wed, Fri at 9:00 AM")

### Waking Early
Click the **wake** button to open the tab now. The recurring schedule continues—next occurrence still happens.

### Canceling
Click the **delete** button to stop the recurring snooze entirely.

## Missed Recurring Snoozes

If your browser wasn't open when a recurring snooze was scheduled:
- It's marked as **Missed** (not expired like one-time snoozes)
- You can manually wake it
- Next occurrence is still scheduled

## Use Cases

| Scenario | Schedule |
|----------|----------|
| Daily standup | Daily at 9:55 AM |
| Hacker News check | Daily at 8:00 AM |
| Weekly team sync | Weekly on Mon at 9:00 AM |
| Sprint planning | Weekly on Mon at 10:00 AM |
| Monthly 1:1 prep | Monthly on 1st at 9:00 AM |

## Tips

1. **Schedule 5 minutes early** for meeting tabs
2. **Use weekly** for standups that skip weekends
3. **Combine with workspaces** to organize recurring tabs by project
4. **Review periodically** - cancel recurring snoozes you no longer need
