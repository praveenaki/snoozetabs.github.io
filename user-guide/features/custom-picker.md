## The Custom Picker

### Date Selection
- Calendar picker for any future date
- Minimum date: today
- No maximum limit

### Time Selection
- 24-hour or 12-hour format (based on your locale)
- Defaults to current time rounded up

### Repeat Option (PRO)
Toggle **Repeat** to create recurring snoozes. See [Recurring Snoozes](recurring.md) for details.

## Use Cases

| Scenario | Custom Time |
|----------|-------------|
| Meeting at 3:30 PM | Pick today, 3:25 PM |
| Project deadline Friday | Pick Friday, 9:00 AM |
| Monthly report | Pick the 1st, 8:00 AM |
| Specific appointment | Pick exact date/time |

## Tips

1. **Round up** - Give yourself a few minutes buffer
2. **Use presets when possible** - Faster than custom picking
3. **Combine with Repeat** - For recurring schedules (PRO)
4. **Check the Sleeping tab** - Verify your snooze was created

## Validation

The picker prevents invalid selections:
- Can't pick a time in the past
- Can't pick today if current time has passed
- Shows warning for very long snoozes (30+ days)
