# Workspaces (PRO)

Organize snoozes and saved items into named categories.

## How Workspaces Work

Workspaces let you:
- Group snoozes by project, context, or purpose
- Filter the Sleeping and Saved tabs
- Keep work and personal tabs separate

## Creating a Workspace

1. Click the workspace selector (top right)
2. Click **"New Workspace"**
3. Enter a name (max 20 characters)
4. Choose an emoji icon
5. Click **Create**

## Assigning Snoozes to Workspaces

When snoozing a tab:
1. Click **"Pick a date & time"**
2. Select a workspace from the dropdown
3. Complete the snooze

Or when using presets:
- Snoozes go to currently selected workspace
- Or "No workspace" if viewing "All"

## Filtering by Workspace

Use the workspace selector to filter:
- **All** - Shows all snoozes and saved items
- **[Workspace name]** - Shows only that workspace + unassigned items

## Managing Workspaces

### Editing
1. Click workspace selector
2. Click the edit icon next to a workspace
3. Change name or emoji
4. Save

### Deleting
1. Click workspace selector
2. Click delete icon
3. Confirm deletion
4. Snoozes become unassigned (not deleted)

## Use Cases

| Workspace | Contains |
|-----------|----------|
| 🏢 Work | Project tabs, meeting docs |
| 🏠 Personal | Articles, personal projects |
| 📚 Learning | Tutorials, courses, docs |
| 🛒 Shopping | Product pages, comparisons |

## Tips

1. **Keep workspaces broad** - Too many defeats the purpose
2. **Use emojis** - Quick visual identification
3. **Review periodically** - Delete unused workspaces
4. **Default workspace** - Set your most-used as default
