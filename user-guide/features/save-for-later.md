# Save for Later

Save tabs without a schedule—perfect for reference docs and content you'll access on-demand.

## How It Works

**Save for Later** creates a bookmark-like entry without a wake time:
- Tab closes immediately
- Appears in the **Saved** tab
- Stays there until you manually open it
- No automatic wake—you decide when

## When to Use Save for Later

| Use Save for Later | Use Snooze Instead |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Reference documentation | News you check daily |
| API docs you consult occasionally | Articles you'll read once |
| Tutorials to revisit | Time-sensitive content |
| Resources without a deadline | Tabs with a natural "when" |

### Good candidates for Save:
- TypeScript Handbook
- React Reference docs
- Stack Overflow answers
- GitHub repos you reference

### Better as Snooze:
- Hacker News (snooze to tomorrow)
- That MDN guide you'll read this weekend
- Meeting notes for next week

## How to Save a Tab

1. Click the Snooze Tabs icon
2. Click **"Save for Later"** button
3. Tab closes and appears in Saved tab

## Managing Saved Items

### Opening Saved Items
- Go to **Saved** tab
- Click the **Open** icon on any item
- Tab opens in current window

### Deleting Saved Items
- Hover over the item
- Click the **trash** icon
- Item is removed permanently

## Saved vs Snoozed

| Feature | Saved | Snoozed |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Wake time | None | Scheduled |
| Auto-opens | No | Yes |
| Badge count | Shows in Saved tab | Shows in Sleeping tab |
| Best for | Reference docs | Time-based content |

## Tips

1. **Save reference docs** you'll need multiple times
2. **Snooze one-time reads** like news articles
3. Use **Saved** as a "reading list" without pressure
4. Combine with **Workspaces** (PRO) to organize saved items by project
